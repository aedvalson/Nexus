Proxal Icon Set 2.0

What It Is:
A complete icon replacement set for Miranda IM.

What It Isn't:
A toaster.

--------------------
Folder description

Miranda IM - The pre-hacked version of Miranda.
Icons - All the icons, in .ico format!
PSD - The resource files themselves.

--------------------

Feel free to use this icon set any way you wish, just not commercially. Using the icons on your website, or custom mods, or even applications is fine by me. I just ask that you be so kind as to place a credit to me somewhere in your works. On websites a comment tag will suffice. You do not need to get prior permission from me in order to use them.

The PSD files are there for you to play around with, and hopefully learn the art of very small icon creation. :)
